- **Apollo People Search Route (`/apollo/people-search`)**
  - Changed `per_page` from 10 to 100
  - Updated comment to indicate the 100 result limit

- **Apollo Company Search Route (`/apollo/company-search`)**

#### 2. Frontend - `frontend/src/components/Prospecting/ProspectingTool.js`

### Deployment Status
- ✅ Changes committed to GitHub repository
- ⏳ Render deployment in progress (automatic deployment triggered by GitHub push)
- Deployment typically takes 2-3 minutes to complete

### Testing Instructions
Once deployment is complete:
1. Navigate to https://projectx-frontend-3owg.onrender.com
2. Log in with your account
3. Click on "Prospecting" in the sidebar
4. Test both People Search and Company Search
5. Verify that results are limited to 100 entries maximum

### Notes
- The 100 result limit helps manage API credit usage
- This is a per-request limit - pagination can be implemented if more results are needed
- The limit applies to both people and company searches

### Current Apollo API Status
- API key is configured on Render
- API key is valid and authenticates successfully
- **Note**: If searches return empty results despite finding matches, this indicates insufficient API credits or plan limitations on the Apollo account
