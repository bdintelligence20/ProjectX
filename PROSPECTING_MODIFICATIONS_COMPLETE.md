## Implementation Details

### Location Dropdown Code
```javascript
const locationOptions = [
  { value: 'South Africa', label: 'South Africa' },
  { value: 'Kenya', label: 'Kenya' }
];

// In the form:
<FormControl fullWidth>
  <InputLabel>Person Location</InputLabel>
  <Select
    value={peopleSearch.personLocations}
    onChange={(e) => setPeopleSearch({
      ...peopleSearch,
      personLocations: e.target.value
    })}
  >
    <MenuItem value="">
      <em>None</em>
    </MenuItem>
    {locationOptions.map((option) => (
      <MenuItem key={option.value} value={option.value}>
        {option.label}
      </MenuItem>
    ))}
  </Select>
</FormControl>
```

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test the Person Location dropdown to ensure it only shows South Africa and Kenya
2. Verify that searches work correctly with the limited location options
3. Confirm that no company domains or keywords fields appear in the UI
4. Ensure the search functionality works without the removed fields

## Status
✅ All requested modifications have been completed successfully. The Prospecting Tool now has a cleaner, more focused interface with only the essential search fields.
