# Apollo Integration Fix - Contact Reveal Implementation

## Issue Summary
Date: September 2, 2025

The Apollo integration was finding contacts but not revealing their details (emails, phone numbers) despite having sufficient credits (2,845 available).

## Root Cause
The API calls were missing the `reveal_contact_info` parameter, which is required to unlock contact details and use credits.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Backend Updates (`backend/app/routes.py`)

#### Apollo People Search Route
```python
apollo_payload = {
    'page': 1,
    'per_page': 50,  # Reduced from 100 to 50
    'reveal_contact_info': True,  # Added to unlock contacts
}
```

#### Apollo Company Search Route
```python
apollo_payload = {
    'page': 1,
    'per_page': 50,  # Reduced from 100 to 50
    'reveal_contact_info': True,  # Added to unlock contacts
}
```

#### Credit Usage Tracking
- Both endpoints now return `credits_used` in the response
- This allows the frontend to track credit consumption

### 2. Frontend Updates (`frontend/src/components/Prospecting/ProspectingTool.js`)

#### Enhanced Search Filters

**People Search:**
- **Job Titles**: Multi-select dropdown with categories (C-Level, Directors, Managers, etc.)
- **Departments**: Sales, Marketing, Engineering, Product, HR, Finance, Operations, IT, Customer Success
- **Industries**: Technology, Healthcare, Finance, Retail, Manufacturing, Education, etc.
- **Seniority Levels**: Owner, Founder, C-Suite, VP, Director, Manager, Senior, Entry

**Company Search:**
- Industry filters
- Funding stage options (Seed, Series A-E, IPO, Private)
- Revenue range filters (prepared for future use)
- Technology stack filters (prepared for future use)

#### UI Improvements
- Credit balance display: Shows remaining credits (e.g., "2,845 / 3,015 remaining this month")
- Credit usage warnings: "This search will use up to 50 credits"
- Revealed contact display: Shows actual emails and phone numbers when available
- Functional action buttons: Email and Call buttons now work with mailto: and tel: links

### 3. Credit Conservation
- Reduced search limit from 100 to 50 contacts per search
- Clear credit usage warnings before searches
- Credit balance tracking

## Testing Instructions

1. **Deploy to Render:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix Apollo contact reveal - add reveal_contact_info parameter"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Test People Search:**
   - Go to Prospecting tab
   - Select job titles from dropdown (e.g., CEO, CFO)
   - Add location (e.g., "Johannesburg")
   - Select company size
   - Click "Search People"
   - Verify that emails and phone numbers are now visible

3. **Test Company Search:**
   - Switch to Company Search tab
   - Enter search criteria
   - Click "Search Companies"
   - Verify company details are revealed

4. **Monitor Credits:**
   - Check credit balance before search
   - Perform a search
   - Verify credits were deducted (up to 50 per search)

## Credit Usage Notes

- Each revealed contact costs 1 credit
- Searches are limited to 50 results to conserve credits
- Current balance: 2,845 credits remaining of 3,015 monthly allocation
- At 50 credits per search, you can perform ~57 searches this month

## Future Enhancements

1. **Optional Reveal Toggle**: Add checkbox to search without revealing (preview mode)
2. **Selective Reveal**: Allow revealing individual contacts after preview
3. **Credit Alerts**: Warn when credits are running low
4. **Caching**: Store revealed contacts to avoid duplicate credit usage
5. **Export Feature**: Export revealed contacts to CSV

## Deployment Status

- ✅ Backend changes implemented
- ✅ Frontend changes implemented
- ✅ Credit tracking added
- ✅ UI improvements completed
- ⏳ Ready for deployment to Render

## Important Notes

- The `reveal_contact_info: true` parameter WILL use credits
- Each search can use up to 50 credits (1 per contact revealed)
- Monitor your Apollo account for credit usage
- Consider implementing caching to avoid re-revealing the same contacts
