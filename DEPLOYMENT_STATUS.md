# Deployment Status - Prospecting Feature

## ‚úÖ Fixed: Pinecone Package Issue
- **Problem**: Deployment failed due to pinecone-client package naming conflict
- **Solution**: Updated `backend/requirements.txt` to use `pinecone` instead of `pinecone-client`
- **Status**: Ready for deployment

## Current Package Configuration
The backend now uses the correct pinecone package:
```
pinecone  # ‚úÖ Correct - new package name
```

Instead of the deprecated:
```
pinecone-client  # ‚ùå Deprecated - old package name
```

## Next Steps for Deployment

1. **Commit and push the requirements.txt change**
2. **Render will automatically redeploy with the fixed package**
3. **Add Apollo.io API key to Render environment variables**
4. **Run the Supabase SQL migration for prospect tables**

## Verification Steps After Deployment

1. **Check backend logs**: Should see successful startup without pinecone errors
2. **Test prospecting feature**: Click "Prospecting" button in sidebar
3. **Verify API routes**: Check that `/apollo/people-search` and `/apollo/company-search` are accessible

## Environment Variables Required

Make sure these are set in your Render dashboard:
- `APOLLO_API_KEY` - Your Apollo.io API key
- All existing environment variables (OpenAI, Supabase, etc.)

## Database Setup

Run this SQL in your Supabase SQL Editor:
```sql
-- Copy contents from: backend/supabase_migrations/create_prospect_tables.sql
```

The prospecting feature is now ready for production deployment! üöÄ
