# Research Feature - Issues and Fixes

## Date: September 3, 2025

## Issues Identified

### 1. Domain Extraction Issue
**Problem**: System was not properly using the email domain for company identification
- Was using Apollo ID "4792" instead of extracting domain from email (e.g., ford.com)
- Company website wasn't being properly identified

**Fix Applied**:
- Enhanced domain extraction logic to prioritize email domain
- Added fallback to www version if main domain fails
- Properly handles corporate domains (e.g., ford.com → Ford Motor Company)
- Added logging to track domain extraction

### 2. LinkedIn Scraping Limitations
**Problem**: LinkedIn has strong anti-scraping measures preventing data access
- Most LinkedIn URLs return limited or no data due to platform restrictions

**Fix Applied**:
- Added proper error handling for LinkedIn scraping failures
- System now acknowledges LinkedIn restrictions in the report
- Falls back to using Apollo-provided data when LinkedIn is inaccessible
- Added informative messaging about data limitations

### 3. Report Styling Issues
**Problem**: Research reports displayed in plain monospace font, not matching app design

**Fix Applied**:
- Complete redesign of research report display
- Added proper section headers with underlines
- Bullet points now use green dots matching app theme
- Proper typography hierarchy (h6, subtitle1, body2)
- Color scheme matches app (dark headers, gray text)
- Bold text support for emphasis
- Responsive layout with proper spacing

## Technical Changes

### Backend (routes.py)
```python
# Enhanced domain extraction
if prospect_email and '@' in prospect_email:
    domain = prospect_email.split('@')[1].lower()
    skip_domains = ['gmail.com', 'yahoo.com', ...]
    if domain not in skip_domains:
        company_website = f"https://{domain}"
        
# Better LinkedIn handling
if not linkedin_data or len(linkedin_data) < 100:
    linkedin_data = "LinkedIn profile data not accessible due to platform restrictions."

# Enhanced prompt context
"Email Domain: {prospect_email.split('@')[1] if prospect_email else 'Unknown'}"
"IMPORTANT CONTEXT: If the email domain suggests a major company..."
```

### Frontend (ProspectingTool.js)
```javascript
// Better company name extraction
company_name: person.organization_name || person.account?.name || 'Unknown Company'

// Enhanced report styling
<Box sx={{ 
  lineHeight: 1.8,
  color: '#1a2332',
  '& h1, & h2, & h3': {
    color: '#1a2332',
    fontWeight: 600,
    marginTop: '1.5rem',
    marginBottom: '1rem'
  },
  // ... more styling
}}>
```

## Results

1. **Domain Recognition**: Now correctly identifies company from email domain
   - Example: thabo@ford.com → Ford Motor Company website research

2. **Data Transparency**: Clear messaging about data limitations
   - LinkedIn restrictions acknowledged
   - Domain-based inference when website data is limited

3. **Professional Presentation**: Research reports now match app design
   - Clean, readable formatting
   - Clear section separation
   - Consistent color scheme
   - Mobile-responsive layout

## Best Practices for Usage

1. **Email Domains**: Ensure prospects have corporate email addresses for best results
2. **LinkedIn**: Expect limited LinkedIn data due to platform restrictions
3. **Report Quality**: Reports will be most comprehensive when:
   - Corporate email domain is available
   - Company website is accessible
   - Role and industry context is clear

## Future Improvements

1. Add alternative data sources beyond LinkedIn
2. Implement caching for frequently researched domains
3. Add export to PDF functionality
4. Include social media research (Twitter/X, etc.)
5. Add confidence scoring for research findings
