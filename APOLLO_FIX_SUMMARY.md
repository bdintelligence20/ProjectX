# Apollo API Integration Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
- Apollo API was returning `total_entries: 34618` but `contacts: []` (empty array)
- The API was finding matches but not returning actual contact/company data

## Root Causes Found
1. **Incorrect API endpoint URLs**: Was using `/api/v1/mixed_people/search` instead of `/v1/mixed_people/search`
2. **Missing filter parameter**: Need to include `prospected_by_current_team: ['no']` to get actual results
3. **Default per_page too low**: Increased default and added limit of 100 as requested

## Fixes Applied

### Backend Changes (backend/app/routes.py)
1. **Fixed API URLs**:
   - People: `https://api.apollo.io/v1/mixed_people/search` (removed `/api` prefix)
   - Companies: `https://api.apollo.io/v1/mixed_companies/search` (removed `/api` prefix)

2. **Added prospected_by_current_team filter**:
   ```python
   apollo_payload = {
       'page': data.get('page', 1),
       'per_page': min(data.get('per_page', 10), 100),  # Limited to 100
       'prospected_by_current_team': ['no'],  # Critical for getting results
   }
   ```

3. **Improved error handling and logging**:
   - Added detailed logging for debugging
   - Better error messages for credit/permission issues

### Frontend Changes (ProspectingTool.js)
1. **Added warning messages** for when API finds matches but can't retrieve data
2. **Added empty state handling** for better UX
3. **Fixed backend URL configuration** for proper API routing

## Deployment Status
- **Pushed to GitHub**: 02/09/2025, 12:36 pm
- **Backend Deployment**: Automatic via Render (typically 2-3 minutes)
- **Frontend Deployment**: Automatic via Render (typically 2-3 minutes)

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Backend deployed successfully on Render
- [ ] Frontend deployed successfully on Render
- [ ] Test Apollo connection works
- [ ] People search returns actual contact data
- [ ] Company search returns actual organization data
- [ ] Results are limited to 100 max
- [ ] Save prospect functionality works
- [ ] Saved prospects display correctly

## Important Notes
1. **API Key**: Confirmed to be configured on Render environment variables
2. **API Credits**: User confirmed they are under their Apollo.io quota
3. **Rate Limits**: Added proper handling for rate limit responses

## Next Steps
1. Wait 2-3 minutes for Render deployment to complete
2. Test the prospecting feature end-to-end
3. Verify actual contact/company data is being returned
4. Confirm the 100 result limit is working
